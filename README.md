<h1 align="center">Image Processor</h1>

This project was given as a final exam from "Object Oriented Programming 2" at Singidunum University. The goal of this course was to continue with OOP concepts that were taught before through Java.

The project had a free topic and it required that we use OOP concepts learned throughout the course. As the subject of the project, I decided to make a Image Processing program that takes an input image and applies one or more filters on said image and save it back to the file system.

## ðŸ’¡ Features

Features this program has:

- Save/Load 32-bit and 24-bit BMP images
- Apply various filters onto the image
- Menu
- Creating filter presets
